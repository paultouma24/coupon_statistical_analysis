The data origin is from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/603/in+vehicle+coupon+recommendation)

## Summary of Findings

#### Bar Coupons
Bar coupons are significantly more likely to be accepted by those who already go to the bars at least once a month, and those don't have kids in the car. Furthermore, the younger the crowd (above legal limit of course), and especially those young adults who visit bars heavily already, are over 35% more likely to accept. 

#### Coupons for 'Cheap Restaurants'(as defined by UCI)
Findings demonstrate that those with graduate degrees have the lowest(-10%) cheap restaurant acceptance rate compared to the overall mean. Additionally, we see that coupons handed out at relevant eating times (10AM - 6PM) are most effective. Finally, we discover two peaks in acceptance rates with respect to age: first for young adults and second for the middle-aged crowd, following somewhat of a bimodal distribution.
